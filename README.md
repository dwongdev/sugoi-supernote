## Apps Sideloading
An **APK** (Android Package Kit) is the file format used for installing applications on Android devices. An APK file contains all the necessary components for an app to be installed and run on an Android device. *Sideloading* is when you install apps or transfer files to your device from places other than the official app store. For example, you might download an app from a website and install it on your phone. It can be useful, but it also comes with risks, like getting a virus, because the apps or files aren’t checked by the official app store. So proceed with caution and download from reputable APK websites.

**Note:** The APKs mentioned here are sourced from the official Google Play Store but are also replicated on APK Mirror and other APK sites, a platform that hosts legitimate APK files while adhering to a strict no-piracy policy. Although these sites ensures the authenticity of its hosted apps, users should be cautious as downloading from third-party sources can pose security risks and may not provide automatic updates. Always prioritize downloading apps from trusted sources to support developers and maintain device security.

### CAUTION FAKE*
There is no official website for MagisK. Only the Github version is legit https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk.<br>
If you searched Magisk on google and found this on another website. It is a virus and malware. Please be very careful on where you download APK's etc and check the url address. See proof below.<br>
<p>**Google searches:**<br>

I downloaded the fake MagisK for fun and uploaded it to VT. <br>
<img width="1368" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cbcc288-a78c-4ef0-9e25-5ea4734ecf8b"><br>
DO NOT INSTALL/SIDELOAD THIS ON YOUR DEVICE. IT CAN GET ACCESS TO YOUR BANK ACCOUNTS ETC.

### Basic Cyber Security Etiquette - Anti Virus Scan
Ensure your APK's are safe by scanning them with these reputable antivirus websites. It's better to be safe than sorry!
* [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) - Free online service that analyses files and URLs for viruses, worms, trojans, and other kinds of malicious content. It uses over 70 antivirus scanners and URL/domain blocklisting services to check for threats1. Users can upload files or enter URLs to get a detailed report on potential security issues

## Apps Sideloading
Sideloading is when you install apps or transfer files to your device from places other than the official app store. For example, you might download an app from a website and install it on your phone. It can be useful, but it also comes with risks, like getting a virus, because the apps or files aren’t checked by the official app store. So proceed with caution and download from reputable APK websites.

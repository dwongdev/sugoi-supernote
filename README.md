# Sugoi-Supernote
A collection of templates, tutorials, guides, and other useful resources for the Ratta Supernote e-ink tablet.<br>
What does ***'sugoi'*** („Åô„Åî„ÅÑ)  mean? It translates to 'cool/awesome' in Japanese. Since someone already had the awesome-supernote, I decided to create the sugoi-supernote instead =D

**Note:** Beware! Do your own research as there are many fake Etsy store ratings. Few months ago (forgot which store, it had high ratings), I checked the feedback comments where 1 user mentioned, the product is a defect and have many fake reviews (most likely bought reviews).
